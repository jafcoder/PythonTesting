## Python has no command for declaring a variable

myName = "Bob"

## Variables are also not case sensitive, you can use the same variable name with different casing to create new variables

myname = "Jeff"

print("")
print("This is the CamelCase variable:", myName)
print("")
print("This is the lowercase variable:", myname)


## Python allows you to declare multiple variables in one line
print("")

r,p,s = "rock", "paper", "scissors"
print(r)
print(p)
print(s)
